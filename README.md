# Errority

**Pronunciation:** `/ˈɛr.ɔːˌrɪ.ti/` (EH-raw-rih-tee)

Errority is a Rust + JavaScript system that treats every input as a candidate for meaning.  
Nothing is pointless by default: knowledge is created through disagreement, argument, and the struggle for fair coexistence.

- Rust core: transforms raw inputs into argument-based knowledge.
- Rust CLI: quick local interface.
- Rust WASM: bridge for web and JS.
- JS app: interactive console.
- JS tools: Node CLI wrapper.

Fairness here means a *right to exist and to argue* without being erased by greed or anger.
