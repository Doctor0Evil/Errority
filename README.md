# Errority
a system identifies, interprets, and autonomously corrects technical or logical errors using rec-analysis, data-driven heuristics, and adaptive feedback loops. Errority denotes a machine’s or program’s evolving capacity to quantify, classify, and self-learn from errors—converting mistakes into intelligent refinements of code, logic, or design.
