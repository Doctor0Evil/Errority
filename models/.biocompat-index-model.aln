# 1. Scope
description: >
  Biocompatibility Index (BCI*) and Risk of Harm (RoH) model for sovereign
  neurocybernetic integrations with my body and biosphere. This file is
  constitutional: it defines hard ceilings and monotone safety invariants
  that no runtime, vendor, or update may violate.

# 2. DEFAULTBIOPHYSEVIDENCE bundle
DEFAULTBIOPHYSEVIDENCE:
  # Axes are normalized to [0,1]; 1.0 represents clinically significant hazard.
  axes:
    - name: S_cognitive_load
      modality: EEG + eye + task metrics
      evidence_refs:
        - pmc: "EEG workload & fatigue classification"
        - mdpi: "cognitive load, beta/gamma increase, alpha decrease"
      normalization:
        unit: "μV² (β band), pupil mm, task error rate"
        rule: |
          Map sustained β-band power ≥ 4 μV², reduced α, and task-error
          plateau into S_cognitive_load = 1.0; healthy-rest baselines map to 0.0.
      stress_label: "mental fatigue / overload"

    - name: S_autonomic
      modality: HRV
      evidence_refs:
        - sciencedirect: "HRV as fatigue/autonomic balance indicator"
        - pmc: "HF-HRV inverse to IL-6/CRP"
      normalization:
        unit: "ms (SDNN), LF/HF ratio"
        rule: |
          SDNN < 30 ms and LF/HF > 3.0 map to S_autonomic = 1.0;
          SDNN > 70 ms and LF/HF ~ 1.0 map to 0.0.

    - name: S_inflammation
      modality: IL-6, CRP, TNF-α, BDNF
      evidence_refs:
        - pmc: "IL-6 > 5 pg/mL, CRP > 3 mg/L pathological"
        - pmc: "MDD, IL-6, TNF-α, low BDNF"
      normalization:
        unit: "pg/mL, mg/L"
        rule: |
          IL-6 ≥ 5 pg/mL or CRP ≥ 3 mg/L -> S_inflammation = 1.0.
          Healthy reference ranges map near 0.0.

    - name: S_tissue_nanorisk
      modality: nanoswarm density, dose-response curves
      evidence_refs:
        - ncbi: "nanotoxicology principles, dose-response"
        - hal: "nanoswarm density limits"
      normalization:
        unit: "particles/ml or mg/kg"
        rule: |
          Use toxicology NOAEL/LOAEL curves: LOAEL dose maps to 1.0;
          ≤ 0.1 * NOAEL maps to 0.0, linear in between unless refined.

    - name: S_eco
      modality: CEIM/NanoKarma, EcoPolytopes
      evidence_refs:
        - NeuroEcoKarma spec (CEIM, NanoKarma, Peco)
      normalization:
        unit: "dimensionless (0–1)"
        rule: |
          S_eco comes from EcoAdmissible / BeeAdmissible distance-to-bound
          in ecological polytopes; 1.0 represents operation at or beyond
          hard ecological limits for my corridors (Phoenix + bees-first).

# 3. Aggregation
BCI_star:
  inputs: [S_cognitive_load, S_autonomic, S_inflammation, S_tissue_nanorisk, S_eco]
  method: "failsafe_max"
  formula: |
    BCI* = max_i S_i (monotone, conservative).
    Alternate weighted mean MAY be used for research dashboards but
    SHALL NOT replace max-form for safety gating.

RoH:
  definition: |
    RoH is a monotone transform of BCI* and additional discrete hazard flags
    (e.g., device fault, uncontrolled stimulation). For all gating, RoH
    MUST satisfy RoH >= BCI*.
  formula: |
    RoH = max( BCI*, F_faults, F_acute_pain, F_device_instability )

# 4. Constitutional ceilings and invariants
ceilings:
  BCI_star_hard_ceiling: 0.30
  RoH_hard_ceiling: 0.30
  preemptive_guard_threshold: 0.25

monotone_invariants:
  - name: "No-increase-BI-and-RoH"
    statement: |
      For any learning step, OTA update, or controller evolution applied
      to a system that can affect my body, neural tissue, or nanoswarm
      fields, the following MUST hold:
        RoH_after <= RoH_before
        BCI*_after <= BCI*_before
      Any proposal that cannot certify these inequalities SHALL be rejected.

  - name: "Envelope-tightening-only"
    statement: |
      For any BiophysicalEnvelopeSpec parameter D (duty cycle, torque,
      stimulation amplitude, session length, swarm density, etc.):
        D_new <= D_old
      i.e., limits may only become stricter over time, never looser.

  - name: "No dreamplex / subconscious targeting"
    statement: |
      Any module implementing n1_dreamplex, n2_dreamplex, dream_context_hooks,
      or functional equivalents (subconscious_state_targeting, off_hours_training_on_brain_state_proxies)
      SHALL NOT be admitted to my runtime.

# 5. Governance hook (EVOLVE token)
evolve_requirements:
  token_type: "EVOLVE"
  properties:
    - short_lived: true
    - revocable: true
    - scoped: ["parameter_subset", "time_window", "device_id"]
    - guards:
        - "RoH_after <= RoH_before"
        - "BCI*_after <= BCI*_before"
        - "BioState in safe band (HRV stable, low pain/fatigue)"
  authority:
    - "SovereigntyCore + multisig quorum + my explicit consent UI"

# 6. Auditability
audit:
  log_channels:
    - "BCI*_timeseries"
    - "RoH_timeseries"
    - "DeniedEvolutionEvents"
    - "EnvelopeTighteningHistory"
  attestations:
    - "Formal verification reports for CLF/CBF controllers"
    - "Probabilistic model checking certificates for QRL policies"

immutability:
  storage: "append-only ALN shard"
  change_control: |
    Any modification of BCI* axes, normalization, or ceilings requires:
      - EVOLVE token with explicit human-readable justification
      - short validity (e.g., 7 days)
      - visible diff and community review
      - right of immediate rollback if biophysical stress rises.
