# Neurorights Compliance Mapping v1.0
`specs/governance/neurorights_compliance_mapping_v1.0.md`

## 1. Purpose

This document maps the Neuro‑EcoKarma governance specification to existing neurorights and AI‑ethics frameworks, to demonstrate legal and ethical alignment.

## 2. Reference Frameworks

- Chilean neurorights constitutional provisions (mental privacy, mental integrity, psychological continuity).
- UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2021).
- OECD Council Recommendation on Responsible Innovation in Neurotechnology.
- Environmental and public‑health regulations governing pollution and exposure.

## 3. Core Neurorights and Corresponding Clauses

### 3.1 Mental Privacy

**Framework requirements:**

- Protection against unauthorized access, recording, or analysis of brain data.
- Prohibition of brain‑data use for surveillance and discrimination.

**Spec alignment:**

- Governance spec §6.1 explicitly forbids brain imaging, BCI logs, and inferred mental states as inputs to any operator or predicate.
- All decisions are based on environmental flows and exposure fields, not neural content.

### 3.2 Cognitive Liberty

**Framework requirements:**

- Freedom to think, believe, and decide without coercion.
- Prohibition of tools that directly manipulate mental states for compliance.

**Spec alignment:**

- Sanction scope restriction in §6.2 prohibits any form of forced neuromodulation or pharmacological intervention.
- External permissions may be adjusted (licenses, roles), but inner mental life remains untouched.

### 3.3 Mental Integrity and Psychological Continuity

**Framework requirements:**

- Protection from interventions that alter or damage cognitive capacities or personal identity.

**Spec alignment:**

- No governance rule in the spec touches mental content or identity; all operations act on role levels and physical permissions.
- Restorative pathways emphasize rehabilitation via environmental repair, not mental re‑engineering.

## 4. Environmental Accountability and Lawfulness

The spec conditions external permissions on:

- Compliance with ecological safety polytopes \(P_{\text{eco}}\).
- Personal ecological Karma above a jurisdictionally defined debt threshold.

This is fully consistent with:

- Environmental permitting regimes (emissions caps, impact thresholds).
- Public‑health‑based regulation of exposures.

The key distinction is that the spec maintains a bright line between:

- **Legitimate regulation of external actions and harms.**
- **Prohibited intrusion into mental states.**

## 5. Equity, Non‑Discrimination, and Justice

The specification:

- Requires that contextual weights \(\lambda_i\) be publicly documented and justified.
- Requires independent audits and distributional analyses to detect bias and disproportionate impacts.
- Provides restorative options accessible to all role levels, to avoid permanent exclusion.

These align with:

- UNESCO AI principles on fairness and non‑discrimination.
- Environmental‑justice frameworks emphasizing disproportionate burdens and participatory decision‑making.

## 6. Open Questions and Further Work

- Formal legal review in specific jurisdictions to adapt wording and thresholds.
- Development of model laws or municipal ordinances that reference the spec directly.
- Integration with data‑protection frameworks (e.g., GDPR‑style regimes) for non‑neural personal data used in implementation.
