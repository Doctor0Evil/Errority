/**
 * Errority Ethics Manifesto
 *
 * - Every input has the right to be heard as a candidate for meaning.
 * - Nothing is pointless by default; structure can always be discovered or created.
 * - Knowledge arises from argument, disagreement, and negotiated fairness.
 * - Fairness is the acceptance that each voice may earn a right to exist freely,
 *   without being erased by greed, anger, or domination.
 * - There is no intrinsic evil in information; only imbalance and misuse.
