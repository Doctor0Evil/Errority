# EcoKarma & Neurorights — Public FAQ and Risk Mitigation v1.0

## 1. What is this system?

EcoKarma is a governance protocol that:

- Measures physical environmental impacts (emissions, waste, fires) using mass-balance physics.
- Converts them into a personal ecological Karma score.
- Uses that score and local ecological conditions to decide what high-impact actions are allowed.

It never measures or scores your thoughts, feelings, or personality.

## 2. How are my neurorights protected?

Your neurorights are treated as absolute:

- Cognitive liberty: You are free to think, imagine, and feel without interference.
- Mental privacy: The system does not read or infer your neural data.
- Mental integrity and identity: No action alters your mind or identity.

Safeguards:

- The math specification explicitly forbids neural inputs.
- Data schemas have no fields for neural metrics.
- Governance manifests declare “no-neural-data” as a machine-enforceable invariant.

## 3. What data does the system use?

Only physical and contextual data, for example:

- Emissions from vehicles, cigarettes, fires.
- Waste and litter counts.
- Environmental sensor readings (PM2.5, NO2, etc.).
- Jurisdictional vulnerability indices (e.g., social vulnerability, baseline health).

No neural, psychological, or personality data are collected or inferred.

## 4. What is my “Karma” score?

Your Karma score, `K_person`, is a running total of your ecological impact:

- Negative values mean you have added more harm than you have helped remove.
- Positive values mean you have contributed to improvement.

It is computed from:

- Measured mass of pollutants/waste,
- Scientific impact factors (α_i),
- Publicly debated justice weights (β_i).

It is a policy tool, not a moral judgment of your worth as a person.

## 5. Can my freedoms be taken away?

Your inner freedoms cannot be taken away:

- No one can use this system to justify reading or changing your mind.
- You retain basic civil rights (movement, speech) regardless of your Karma score.

What can change is:

- Your ability to perform certain high-impact actions (e.g., starting outdoor fires, operating high-emission equipment) under this protocol.

These are conditioned on:

- Current environmental state (EcoAdmissible),
- Your ecological Karma (KarmaAdmissible),
- Transparent role rules (FullOperator, RestrictedOperator, Observer).

## 6. How can I repair a negative Karma score?

Through restorative actions, for example:

- Participating in cleanup or reforestation.
- Funding or operating pollutant removal devices.
- Consistently choosing low-impact behaviors.

These actions generate positive `ΔK_person` and can:

- Restore your privileges,
- Improve shared environments.

The protocol must offer multiple restorative pathways; it is not designed to create a permanent “Karma caste”.

## 7. Could this system be abused?

Risks include:

- Overbroad data collection,
- Biased `β_i` weights,
- Governance capture by powerful actors.

Mitigations:

- Open publication of:
  - Math specifications,
  - Configuration (`A_eco`, `b_eco`, α_i, β_i),
  - Role thresholds.
- Independent audits and community oversight.
- Clear appeal and redress mechanisms.

If abuse is detected, the system MUST be paused and reconfigured before resuming.

## 8. How does this respect all lifeforms?

The protocol:

- Treats your neural existence as an inviolable fact.
- Treats external ecosystems (including bees, habitats, communities) as shared spaces that must remain inside safety envelopes.
- Asks everyone, human and machine, to “earn” external freedom through measurable care for shared ecological conditions.
